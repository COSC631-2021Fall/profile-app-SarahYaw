# profile-app-SarahYaw
Basic profile/CV app made with react to gain a hands-on understanding of React basics. 
Features a "header" section called "App" containing name, contact information, and a photograph of Sarah, as well as a "body" section called "Footer" containing all of the subheaders and their content. The styling comes from App.css, which is imported into both App.js and components.js.
The project is hosted on an EC2 instance and edited via VSCode ssh.
